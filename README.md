# 100-Days-of-Python-AI
I’m starting a 100 Days of Python Mini Projects challenge, building one project every day with the help of AI. This journey will boost my Python skills, creativity, and consistency while creating a portfolio of 100 practical, fun, and AI-assisted projects. Follow along as I learn and build daily!

## Progress

- **Day 01 – Sentiment Analyzer:** CLI utility for classifying text sentiment using pre-trained models.
- **Day 02 – The Intermediate Level in Python:** 45+ focused scripts covering decorators, generators, context managers, asyncio, multiprocessing, data serialization, advanced standard-library tools, and more in `Day02/the-intermediate-level-in-python/`.

Each folder includes runnable examples. Use `python <script>.py` from the folder to explore a concept.
