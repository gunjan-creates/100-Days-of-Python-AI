# Intermediate Level Python Programs

This directory contains Python programs demonstrating intermediate-level concepts such as decorators, generators, and custom context managers. Each script focuses on a single concept with concise examples you can run directly.

- `decorators.py` – Shows how to write and apply function decorators with arguments.
- `generators.py` – Illustrates generator functions and generator expressions for memory-efficient iteration.
- `context_manager.py` – Implements a custom context manager using the `@contextmanager` decorator for resource handling.

Run any script with `python <script_name>.py` to see the concept in action.
